# Kratia Centralized

Kratia enables communities and organizations with digital governance. It offers alternatives to the decision-making process, first, options to the way influence is distributed to the members, and second, options to the way a decision is resolved once members have voted for proposals. It helps the communities grow and evolve faster and healthier because besides automating the collaborative decision making, it also uses the same system to let the community change its current governance method.
There are several exciting industries which would benefit: open software projects, blockchain networks, digital nomad groups, small and big companies, NGOs, distributed autonomous organizations, governments. Also exciting possible features: webhooks for automation, automatic transparency, sub-communities for scaling, composition and combination of complex decision systems, open data for research on governance systems.
