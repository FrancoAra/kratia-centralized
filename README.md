# Kratia Engine Centralized

_Kratia is a model, and an implementation of the model is called a kratia engine._

The notion of community is everywhere in humanity: families, organisations or governments, they all are groups which success is mainly determined by how well they make decisions in collaboration, and how fast the structure of the community adapts to their ecosystem.

Kratia empowers these communities by enabling them with digital governance. It helps the communities grow, evolve and adapt by offering lego blocks for the decision-making process, that is, options to the way influence is distributed to the members, options to the way a decision is resolved once members have voted for proposals, and finally options to the automatization of the decision making process and how the decisions take effect.

There are several exciting industries which would benefit: open software projects, blockchain networks, digital nomad groups, small and big companies, NGOs, distributed autonomous organizations, governments. Also exciting possible features: webhooks for automation, automatic transparency, sub-communities for scaling, composition and combination of complex decision systems, open data for research on governance systems.

# About the code

This is the "centralized" version, it is a traditional service with a websockets API to interact with the protocol.
