The Basic Model
===============

**Keywords** _community, member, registry, decision, event, domain, influence, proposal, vote, ballot, resolution, resolution outcome._

Let us describe informally what it means to make collaborative decision-making. 

First a notion of **community** as a set of **members** is required, all of the decision
power is encapsulated within such community. Secondly, the community must have a 
**registry** to authenticate and authorise members. Following, **decisions** may be triggered
by incoming **events** which are categorised by **domain**. Then a separation is made
between the **influence** that each member has on the decision, and the way in which a
decision is **resolved** into a **resolution outcome** after **votes** over **proposals** have
been collected in a **ballot box**, the voting **ballot** represents not a vote count on a
proposal, but allocated influence of the voting member over the different proposals. 
Proposals might be predefined or previously collected, but we will leave that for a 
future section. Influence distribution and decision resolution are actually just functions, 
called the **influence distribution function** and the **decision resolution function**, and
these together are called the **decision system functions**.
